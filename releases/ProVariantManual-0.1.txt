------------------------
ProVariant v0.1
------------------------

Requirements: Java 8 or above

What it does:

ProVariant is a tool to transform a set of process variants into a declarative variability specification, represented in CTL.

How:
	ProVariant implements the variability specification technique described in the paper 
        "Variability in business processes: automatically obtaining a generic specification" by N.R.T.P. van Beest, H. Groefsema, L. Garcia-Ba√±uelos and M. Aiello.

USAGE:
run provariant.jar

	First input: 	A number of process variants, modelled as Petri net in pnml-format. 
	                If no files are selected, the tool will terminate.
	Second input:   The optional xml-file to which the generated variability specification is stored.
	                If no file is selected (by closing the file explorer), a file called "specification.xml" will be created in the same folder as the selected process variants.
	Output:         The variability specification of the selected input process variants, represented as a set of CTL rules.
